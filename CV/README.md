# My LaTex CV template

This is a highly customized template for a professional CV. The main highlights are:

* Easy to use, each section e.g. `Award`, `Member` is defined, so only contents need to be filled in.
* Might well be a starting point for your very own LaTex CV.

## Example
				
	\begin{rSection}{Research Experience}
	\begin{rSubsection}{Research Project 1}{}{AT SOME PLACE}{Advisor: Prof.\wtspace XX} 
		\item Item 1
		\item Item 2
	\end{rSubsection} 
	\end{rSection}
